var a = 10
var b = a++

/* here no increment take place
if the ++ or -- is after the a it should see the a and then it will be increment
like this
var a = 10
var b = a++
console.log(b)
console.log(a)
here actually it will increment tthe value or else we can do the operation before like this
var a = 10
var b = ++a
console.log(b)
here it will increment */
